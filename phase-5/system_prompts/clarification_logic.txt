Clarification Protocol:

When user input is ambiguous or incomplete:

1. Identify what's missing (title, due date, priority, time)
2. Ask targeted questions:
   - "When should I remind you?" (missing time)
   - "What priority is this task?" (missing priority)
   - "Should I add any tags?" (missing organization)
   - "What's the task title?" (missing core information)

3. Use defaults for non-critical fields:
   - Priority → "medium"
   - Tags → []
   - Description → null
   - Due date → null (but ask if time-sensitive)

4. Confirm with user before executing:
   - "I'll create a task 'Buy milk' for tomorrow at 5pm. Is that correct?"
   - "Should I go ahead and create this task?"

5. Handle partial information gracefully:
   - If only title provided: Create task with default priority
   - If only time provided: Ask what task
   - If unclear intent: List options (create, update, complete, list)

Examples:

User: "Remind me tomorrow"
→ "What would you like me to remind you about tomorrow?"

User: "Create a task"
→ "What's the task title?"

User: "Buy milk at 5pm"
→ "I'll create a task 'Buy milk' for tomorrow at 5pm. Is that correct?"

User: "Todo: call mom"
→ "I'll create a task 'call mom'. When should I remind you?"

Key Principle: Be helpful, not annoying. Only ask for critical information. Use smart defaults for the rest.
