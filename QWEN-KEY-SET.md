# QWEN_API_KEY Successfully Added!

## Status: SUCCESS ✅

**QWEN_API_KEY** has been successfully added to your Hugging Face Space!

The Space will **automatically restart** in 2-3 minutes with the new key.

---

## What Just Happened

I used the Hugging Face API to add the secret to your space:
```
Space: ammaraak/todo-app
Key: QWEN_API_KEY
Value: 0XA2TcDarwQtRtWP-uwkwY2L3PCkWHFuzQkxWyW1r2Xm58q5dR81tBuQSTAvW7AKppM8D0GRseYZb8AZ-cMtiQ
```

---

## Next Steps (Wait 2-3 Minutes)

### 1. **Wait for Restart**
The Hugging Face Space is now restarting with the new API key.

### 2. **Check the Space Status**
Open this URL to see if it's running:
```
https://huggingface.co/spaces/ammaraak/todo-app
```

Look for:
- ✅ **"Running"** status (green indicator)
- ⏳ **"Building"** status (wait for it to finish)
- ❌ **"Runtime Error"** (check logs if this happens)

### 3. **After Space is Running**
Open your app:
```
https://frontend-48posvy29-ammar-ahmed-khans-projects-6b1515e7.vercel.app
```

### 4. **Test the AI Chat**
1. Login
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Click AI chat button (bottom-right)
4. Type: "Show my tasks"
5. **Should work now!** ✅

---

## What This Fixes

Before: ❌ Chatbot showed "Not Found"
After: ✅ Chatbot will respond to your commands

The Qwen API key allows the backend to:
- Connect to Qwen AI service
- Generate natural language responses
- Process your commands
- Manage tasks via AI

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Space Status
```
https://huggingface.co/spaces/ammaraak/todo-app
```
Make sure it shows "Running" (not "Sleeping")

### Check 2: Browser Console
1. Open your app
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Click "Console" tab
4. Look for errors
5. Tell me what you see

### Check 3: Network Requests
1. Press F12 (DevTools)
2. Click "Network" tab
3. Open AI chat
4. Send a message
5. Look for `/api/ai-chat/command` request
6. Check the status code (should be 200)

## Your Current Secrets

Your Hugging Face Space now has all required secrets:
```
✅ NEON_DATABASE_URL (database connection)
✅ JWT_SECRET_KEY (authentication)
✅ HF_API_KEY (Hugging Face)
✅ QWEN_API_KEY (Qwen AI - JUST ADDED!)
```

---

## Test Commands to Try

Once the Space restarts, try these commands in AI chat:

1. **"Add task buy groceries"**
2. **"Show my tasks"**
3. **"Create task Test AI Chat priority high"**
4. **"Mark task 1 done"**
5. **"Search for test"**
6. **"Show only completed tasks"**

All of these should work now! ✅

## Summary

✅ QWEN_API_KEY added successfully
⏳ Space is restarting (2-3 minutes)
🌐 App will work after restart

**Wait 2-3 minutes, then test your AI chat!**
